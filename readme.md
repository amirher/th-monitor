# Linux System Monitoring

th-monitor is a combination client / server software package used to monitor Linux system resource consumption on [Thornleigh Farm](https://thornleighfarm.com).  The objectives of th-monitor are:

- Report critical system resource consumption attributes to a remote database
- Be easily extensible, such that more telemetry may be added in future
- Be insensitive to extreme latency (th-monitor communicates over a geo-sync satellite connection)

I've released th-monitor as Open Source Software under the MIT license so that others may learn and draw inspiration from it. I do not recommend using th-monitor in your own systems. th-monitor was rapidly developed (in less than a day!) and lacks proper documentation and testing apparatus.
